NFD License Agreement
This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between Nano Fusion Design (“NFD”) and the individual or organization (“Licensee”) accessing or otherwise using NFD’s intellectual property (IP) in any form and its associated documentation.

1. Grant of License Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, NFD grants Licensee a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, worldwide license to reproduce, analyze, test, publicly perform and/or display, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use the IP—alone or in any derivative version—provided that:

   (a) This Agreement and NFD’s copyright notice, i.e., Copyright © 2023–2025 Nano Fusion Design; All Rights Reserved, are retained in the IP and any derivative version prepared by Licensee.

3. Disclaimer of Warranty The IP is provided “AS IS” without representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including (without limitation) warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non‑infringement.

4. Limitation of Liability NFD shall not be liable to the Licensee or any other party for any incidental, special, or consequential damages or losses arising from the modification, distribution, or use of the IP or any derivative thereof, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

5. Termination This Agreement terminates automatically upon a material breach of its terms.

6. Relationship of the Parties Nothing in this Agreement creates an agency, partnership, or joint venture between NFD and Licensee. This Agreement does not grant permission to use NFD’s trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services.

7. Acceptance of Terms By copying, incorporating, or otherwise using the IP, Licensee agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

8. Special Provision for Exceptional Circumstances In exceptional or unforeseeable events, revisions to this Agreement will be guided by the public interest, particularly given that hardware development and production differ substantially from software IP rights—generally requiring higher initial costs, more extensive trial and error during development, and greater duplication expenses in production. This provision aims to allow greater flexibility in IP management under unforeseen conditions.
